	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to execute. It is usually expressed using the big O notation, which describes the worst-case scenario of the algorithm's performance. For example, an algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n) means that it takes linear time to complete, proportional to the size of the input n.</p>
<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses in terms of the space it allocates. It is also expressed using the big O notation, which describes the worst-case scenario of the algorithm's space usage. For example, an algorithm that has a space complexity of O(n) means that it takes linear space to store, proportional to the size of the input n.</p>
