    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity and space complexity are two ways of measuring the efficiency of an algorithm. They describe how the running time and the memory usage of an algorithm change as the size of the input increases.</p>
    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>Time complexity is the amount of time that an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size. It is usually expressed using the <strong>Big O notation</strong>, which gives the upper bound of the worst-case scenario of the algorithm. For example, O(n) means that the algorithm takes at most linear time, O(n<sup>2</sup>) means that the algorithm takes at most quadratic time, and so on.</p>
    <p>Some common factors that affect the time complexity of an algorithm are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of loops and nested loops</li>
        <li>The type of data structures and operations used</li>
        <li>The choice of sorting and searching algorithms</li>
        <li>The optimization techniques applied</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
    <p>Space complexity is the amount of memory that an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is also usually expressed using the Big O notation, which gives the upper bound of the worst-case scenario of the algorithm. For example, O(1) means that the algorithm uses constant space, O(n) means that the algorithm uses linear space, and so on.</p>
    <p>Some common factors that affect the space complexity of an algorithm are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The size and type of the input</li>
        <li>The number and size of the variables and data structures used</li>
        <li>The recursion depth and stack size</li>
        <li>The garbage collection and memory management mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
